<h2>Introduction to the GIS Viewer</h2>
<br />
<p>
    The <strong>GIS Viewer</strong> is a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) viewer
    that allows the user to access, query and view spatial data via the web.
</p>
<p>
    The GIS Viewer comprises of several components: a map viewer window, a main menu which includes a predictive
    text search component, a serach results window and a tools side bar where components such as the legend, 
    drawing and measuring tools are hosted.  A footer bar also displays the current map scale, the current XY 
    location, an overview map window, the spatial tool is being used and provides support documentation when 
    you need help.</p> 
<p> <strong>Some of these components and tools are hidden depending on form 
    factor of the device the being used to display the viewer.</strong> e.g. if using a smart phone, the viewer 
    hides the drawing, measuring and navigation tools.  Any example presented in this help site will display 
    screen shots of the viewer in the different form factors.   
</p>
<br />
<strong>Map Viewer Window</strong><br />
<br />
<p>
    The map viewer window displays the available geospatial data in a two
    dimensional space. This data can be viewed at a set range of predetermined multiple
    scales with the extent focused primarily on the Canterbury Region.
</p>
<strong>Predictive Search Menu</strong><br />
<br />
<p>
    The predictive search menu allows the user to locate a spatial feature such as a
    consent, street or bore that closely matches the text entered in the text box provided.
    As the user starts typing a value, a list of items that closely matches the value
    appears. When an item is selected, the map viewer window will automatically zoom
    to and label the location of the feature.
</p>
<p>
    Each time the user searches for a new feature, the map viewer will zoom to that
    location and label the location appropriately. The user can click on the red x button
    next to the search text to remove all previous search results performed by the predictive
    search menu.
</p>
<strong>Base Maps</strong><br />
<br />
<p>
    The base map picker in the tools sidebar allows the user to change the base layer used in the map layer
    window. A user can change this to show either a topographic or basic street map, or current aerial imagery
    by clicking on the appropriate tile in the picker.
